## Security
When you go about this project, one of the key considerations you’ll likely encounter is how to protect your enterprise APIs from hackers or from access from unsanctioned users, apps, or devices. To do this, you’ll have to make sure clients calling your APIs are authenticated, and have the required permissions to access these APIs. 

The MobileFirst Security framework provides the infrastructure that makes it very easy to implement the authentication & authorization logic to protect your APIs when they are accessed from mobile apps, and enforce it at runtime. And the security framework implements the OAuth2 protocol, which apart from being the industry standard protocol to protect APIs, also makes it easy to leverage additional security products in your infrastructure.
