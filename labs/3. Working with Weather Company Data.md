# Working with Weather Company Data

One of the features of the Utilities demo app is the inclusion of alerts when there is inclement weather near a work order. This relies on the Weather Company Data api on Bluemix to provide the alerts.

Since we will focus on incorporating Weather Company Data with the existing Cloudant adapter this lab assumes that the reader has followed all the steps from the [Cloudant](Creating a Cloudant Adapter.md) lab.

## Viewing the API

For our app we want to focus on getting alerts for inclement weather at the site of a work order. In our [Cloudant](Creating a Cloudant Adapter.md) lab we designed a location document for each work order, so that is all the location information we'll have access to. This means we can search for weather based on the street name and number, city, state, and zip code. With that in mind, let's see what Weather Company Data has to offer.

### Swagger

The best place to start is the api reference that is available [here](https://twcservice.mybluemix.net/rest-api/). Right away we can see that there are several sections, one of which is fortunately titled `Weather Alerts`.

![weather](img/Weather/swagger_alerts.png)

There are 5 options here:

1. alert details
2. latitude and longitude
3. country code
4. state code
5. area id

Diving into each one narrows down our choices. **Alert details** only gives us more information about a specific alert, so that doesn't help. **Country code** gives us all the alerts in a country, but that's too broad for a single work order. **State code** gives us all the alerts for a state, which is still too broad.

That leaves us with **area id** and **latitude and longitude**. Unfortunately we don't have either of those in our work order weather document, but the Weather Company Data api also has a section titled `Location Services`, which may be able to help.

![weather](img/Weather/swagger_location.png)

Again we have 5 options for work with:

1. search
2. point
3. postal key
4. iata code
5. icao code

Let's narrow them down. **Point** takes in a latitude and longitude, which we still don't have. Both **IATA code** and **ICAO code** take in data we don't have. Our best options are search, which can take in a city or address and postal key which can take a zip code.

Testing the output for each query (through swagger) we can see that neither option seems to return an area id. This means that we'll have to search for weather alerts based on latitude and longitude. With that in mind, **postal key** seems like the obvious choice. It returns a single latitude and longitude, whereas **search** returns multiple coordinates, which would make it much more complicated.

## Designing the adapter

### Handling limitations

There is a fundamental drawback with only using free services on Bluemix: limits. The free version of the Weather Company Data service only allows us to call the api 10 times a minute. Unfortunately, it takes one call to geocode a zip code and another call to get the alerts for the new latitude and longitude. That means that we're limited to getting the weather for no more than five work orders at a time. If we have more than five active work orders we have a problem. However, finding a way around this only requires that we think about what we want to do in the context of these limits and what tools we have.

The best place to start would be to reduce the number of calls we make each time from two to one. Since we are searching based on zip codes and each zip code returns one latitude and longitude, we can save each zip code and latitude and longitude pair so that we only have to geocode each zip code once. The obvious solution for this is to use Cloudant.

This means we'll have to write a new document. Let's call it `ZipCode.java`. This should be easy as it'll follow the same format as the rest of the documents.

First we need the getters and setters.

```java
public class ZipCode {
    private String zip, latitude, longitude, _id, _rev;

    /**
     * Strings
     */
    public String getZip() {
        return zip;
    }
    public void setZip(String zip) {
        this.zip = zip;
    }
			    .
    			.
    			.
    /**
     * Cloudant IDs
     */
    public String get_id() {
    	return _id;
    }
    public void set_id(String _id) {
    	this._id = _id;
    }

    public String get_rev() {
    	return _rev;
    }
    public void set_rev(String _rev) {
    	this._rev = _rev;
    }
```

Then we need the validation.

```java
/**
 * Methods
 */
public boolean isValid() {
	if (nonNullAndEmpty(zip) && nonNullAndEmpty(latitude) && nonNullAndEmpty(longitude)) {
	    return true;
	}
	else {
		return false;
    }
}

public boolean nonNullAndEmpty(String element) {
    if (element!=null && !element.isEmpty()) {
        return true;
    }
    else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Now we can use this to save the geocoded data and work within our limitations.

### Define the flow

Let's define our flow for getting weather alerts.

1. Get a list of zip codes we want to get alerts for.
2. Send those zip codes to an adapter.
3. The adapter sends the zip codes to Cloudant to get the coordinates.
4. If the zip codes isn't there, send it to the Weather Company Data api.
5. Get the coordinates and send them to Cloudant for future calls.
6. Take all the coordinates and send them to the Weather Company Data api.
7. Return the alerts.

Since we're making calls to Cloudant we can reuse some of the code we wrote for our Cloudant adapter. To make everything easier we'll be adding this to our already existing Utilities adapter.

## Writing the code

***Note: Some of the code below has been edited to remove lines specific to Cloudant. You can view the complete files by cloning the repo.***

### Accessing the api

We should start by setting up our Weather Company Data variables. In order to access the api we need to have the username and password for our instance. Adding the following lines in `adapter.xml` adds them as fields in our server console.

```xml
<property name="weatherUsername" displayName="Weather Username" defaultValue=""/>
<property name="weatherPassword" displayName="Weather Password" defaultValue=""/>
```

Next we need to read them. We are already reading the Cloudant variables in `UtilitiesApplication.java` so we'll do it the same way.

```java
public String weatherUsername;
public String weatherPassword;

protected void init() throws Exception {
	logger.info("Adapter initialized!");
    weatherUsername = configurationAPI.getPropertyValue("weatherUsername");
	weatherPassword = configurationAPI.getPropertyValue("weatherPassword");
}
```

Before we can move on we still need to use those variables in our `UtilitiesResource.java` file. For our adapter calls we'll use the `okhttp3` library, so we need to set the weather username and password as our credentials.

```java
private String getCredentials() {
    UtilitiesApplication app = adaptersAPI.getJaxRsApplication(UtilitiesApplication.class);
    if (!app.weatherUsername.isEmpty() && !app.weatherPassword.isEmpty()) {
        return Credentials.basic(app.weatherUsername, app.weatherPassword);
    } else {
        return "";
    }
}
```

Now when we make a call to the api we include the credentials and it will handle authentication.

### Adding the zip code to Cloudant

This will take a zip code object and POST it to Cloudant. Luckily we have code we can reuse from our Cloudant lab. The main difference is that we will set the `_id` field to be the word "zip" and the zip code. This will make it easier to search for zip codes in the future.

```java
// POST a new zip code and coordinates to Cloudant
private Response addZipCode(ZipCode zipCode) throws Exception {
	if(zipCode!=null && zipCode.isValid()) {
        // Handle SSL issue
        fixSSL();

        // Set the id
		zipCode.set_id("zip" + zipCode.getZip());

		// Handle Cloudant
		String err = getDB().post(zipCode).getError();

		if (err != null) {
			return Response.status(500).entity(err).build();
		}
		else {
			return Response.status(201).entity(zipCode).build();
		}

	}
	else {
		return Response.status(400).entity("Invalid zip code document").build();
	}
}
```

### Geocoding with Weather Company Data

We also need a function to get the latitude and longitude from the Weather Company Data api. This is pretty easy. All we have to do is make a request to the api endpoint, provide the credentials, and parse the output.

```java
// GET latitude and longitude for a specific zip code
private JSONObject geocode(String zip) throws Exception {
    OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url("https://twcservice.mybluemix.net/api/weather/v3/location/point?postalKey=" + zip + "%3AUS&language=en-US")
        .get()
        .addHeader("Authorization", getCredentials())
        .build();

    okhttp3.Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
    String body = response.body().string();
    JSONObject json = JSONObject.parse(body);

    JSONObject output = new JSONObject();
    output.put("latitude", ((JSONObject)json.get("location")).get("latitude"));
    output.put("longitude", ((JSONObject)json.get("location")).get("longitude"));
    return output;
}
```

### Getting the alerts

Now that we have the latitude and longitude we can get the alerts. This is almost exactly the same as geocoding. In fact, it's even easier, since we don't have to parse the data at the end, we can just return it as is.

```java
// GET alerts for a specific latitude and longitude
private String alerts(String latitude, String longitude) throws Exception {
    OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url("https://twcservice.mybluemix.net/api/weather/v1/geocode/" + latitude + "/" + longitude + "/alerts.json?language=en-US")
        .get()
        .addHeader("Authorization", getCredentials())
        .build();

    okhttp3.Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
    return response.body().string();
}
```

### Writing the endpoint

We should start with the output. Starting from the bottom up, the Weather Company Data api returns alert details as a JSON object, so we'll use that as our lowest level. On top of that are multiple possible alerts for a single location, so we should have a JSON array for each zip code. And since there are multiple zip codes we're returning, the whole thing should be a JSON object.

```java
// POST a zip code array to update the weather
@POST
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes("application/json")
@Path("/weather")
public Response getWeatherAlerts(String[] zipCodes) throws Exception {
    /*
     * Output structure
     *  - zipLevel: outer most object
     *  - alertLevel: inner array of alerts for each zip
     *  - detailLevel: inner most object for alert details
     */
    JSONObject zipLevel = new JSONObject();
```

Now we can work to reach our desired output. The first step is to send the zip code array to Cloudant to search for coordinates.

```java
String latitude;
String longitude;

// Handle SSL issue
fixSSL();

for (int i = 0; i < zipCodes.length; i++) {
    // Get lat/long for zips
    try {
		ZipCode dbZip = getDB().find(ZipCode.class, "zip" + zipCodes[i]);

        latitude = dbZip.getLatitude();
        longitude = dbZip.getLongitude();

	}
```

We need to wrap our Cloudant search in a try-catch in case the document is missing. In that case we'll call our geocode method and add it to Cloudant.

```java
catch(NoDocumentException e){
    // Get the coordinates from the weather service
    JSONObject latLong = geocode(zipCodes[i]);

    // Add the zip code to Cloudant
    ZipCode newZip = new ZipCode();
    newZip.setZip(zipCodes[i]);
    newZip.setLatitude(latLong.get("latitude").toString());
    newZip.setLongitude(latLong.get("longitude").toString());

    Response cloudantRes = addZipCode(newZip);

    // Check for errors when adding the zip
    if (cloudantRes.getStatus() == 201) {
        latitude = newZip.getLatitude();
        longitude = newZip.getLongitude();

    } else {
        // Assume zip is invalid
        continue;
    }
}
```

Now we can use our alerts method to get the alerts for our new coordinates. Unfortunately the alerts return is always a 200, so we have to parse the alerts output to see if there are actually any alerts based on the response code inside. Then we combine it all and return the original JSON object we defined at the start.

```java
	// Get weather alerts from lat/long
    String weatherRes = alerts(latitude, longitude);

    // Java casting magic
    JSONObject weatherJSON = JSONObject.parse(weatherRes);
    int code = Integer.parseInt(((JSONObject)weatherJSON.get("metadata")).get("status_code").toString());

    if (code == 200) {
        JSONArray allInfo = (JSONArray)weatherJSON.get("alerts");
        JSONArray alertLevel = new JSONArray();

        // Grab the data for each alert
        for (int j = 0; j < allInfo.size(); j++) {
            JSONObject detailLevel = new JSONObject();
            detailLevel.put("severity", ((JSONObject)allInfo.get(j)).get("severity"));
            detailLevel.put("headline", ((JSONObject)allInfo.get(j)).get("headline_text"));

            alertLevel.add(detailLevel);
        }

        zipLevel.put(zipCodes[i], alertLevel);

    } else {
        // No alerts for zip code
        zipLevel.put(zipCodes[i], null);

    }
}
return Response.ok(zipLevel).build();
```

By combining all the above pieces together into an adapter we can now use the Mobile Foundation server, Cloudant, and Weather Company Data api to get alerts for individual work orders.
