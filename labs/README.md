# Advanced Utilities Demo

In this lab, we will be taking on the role of an application developer who works for a Utility company. The company sends out repair technicians who need to routinely inspect various pieces of equipment in the field. We will develop an application for these field technicians that will display a list of their assigned Work Orders, use The Weather Company data to alert if there is inclement weather at the intended location, and use IBM Watson's Speech to Text service to make it easy to fill out the inspection form without having to type everything in.

## Quick Start

Make sure that you view the [Quickstart lab](/0.\ Quick\ Start.md) to get up and running with the complete demo quickly. This part of the lab includes a script you can run that will automatically provision the needed Bluemix services, build the adapters we will be using, set up and install all of our Cordova plugins, and then build and run the sample application. This is the easiest way to get started with the full lab.

## Tips
Here is a collection of tips that we found to be useful when developing this application:

1. Hybrid app development is hard. Even though the tools have come a long way in the last few years, it still takes a lot of time and effort to develop a proper mobile application in JavaScript that works on multiple platforms. Make sure that you test frequently in both real devices, simulators, and just using the browser. You can search online for great Cordova or Ionic development tutorials.
1. There are many resources available online if you get stuck. Frequently, a few minutes of searching online will yield solutions - do not forget to check out StackOverflow!
