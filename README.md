## Scenario

This app is a sample for a utilities inspection company. This company sends inspectors out to detail and report on a utilities information and status.

The app provides several specific functions:

1. Prompts the inspector with a login page to keep the data secure from unauthorized access
2. Maintains a list of work orders for each inspector, and provides a from to fill them out when completed
3. Checks the weather at the site of each work order to alert the inspector of dangerous weather conditions ahead of time
4. Transcribes speech so the work order can be completed by reading the inspection information
